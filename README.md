# Simple-Customer-Cuisine-Recommendation-Model
As a take home assesment for a food delivery company, I created a simple user based collaborative filtering recommendation model with a dataset consisting of a cuisine, customer ID and order counts.

## Overview
X company's front end is displaying by restaurant level. Each of restaurant has unique primary cuisine and multiple secondary cuisines. 
The platform wants to create a recommendation lane to customers top 3 cuisines they are likelihood to choose but have never ordered before.
